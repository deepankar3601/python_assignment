    "#          An abstract method is a method that is declared, but does not contain implementation. An abstract method in a base class identifies the functionality that should be implemented by all its subclasses. However, since the implementation of an abstract method would differ from one subclass to another, often the method body comprises just a pass statement. Every subclass of the base class will ride this method with its implementation. A class containing abstract methods is called abstract class.Python provides the abc module to use the abstraction in the Python program, syntax as:\n",

    "# To use Python Abstract Base Classes (ABCs), one needs to import ABCMeta and abstractmethod from the abc module. For example,let us examine the class Shape and its subclasses Rectangle and Circle defined in the script shape . Each of the subclasses Rectangle and Circle needs methods for computing area and perimeter. However, the procedure for computing area and perimeter would differ for Rectangle and Circle. Therefore, we define the classes Rectangle and Circle as subclasses of the class Shape. We define methods area and perimeter as abstract methods in the class Shape. The subclasses Rectangle and Circle override the methods area and perimeter by defining their implementation as shown in the program. If the subclasses Rectangle and Circle fail to override any of the methods area or perimeter, Python will yield a TypeError while instantiating them."
