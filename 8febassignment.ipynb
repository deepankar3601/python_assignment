    "Abstract base classes provide a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that don’t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. There are many built-in ABCs in Python. ABCs for Data structures like Iterator, Generator, Set, mapping etc. are defined in collections.abc module. The numbers module defines numeric tower which is a collection of base classes for numeric data types. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.\n",

    "         An abstract method is a method that is declared, but does not contain implementation. An abstract method in a base class identifies the functionality that should be implemented by all its subclasses. However, since the implementation of an abstract method would differ from one subclass to another, often the method body comprises just a pass statement. Every subclass of the base class will ride this method with its implementation. A class containing abstract methods is called abstract class.Python provides the abc module to use the abstraction in the Python program, syntax as:\n",

For example,let us examine the class Shape and its subclasses Rectangle and Circle defined in the script shape . Each of the subclasses Rectangle and Circle needs methods for computing area and perimeter. However, the procedure for computing area and perimeter would differ for Rectangle and Circle. Therefore, we define the classes Rectangle and Circle as subclasses of the class Shape. We define methods area and perimeter as abstract methods in the class Shape. The subclasses Rectangle and Circle override the methods area and perimeter by defining their implementation as shown in the program. If the subclasses Rectangle and Circle fail to override any of the methods area or perimeter, Python will yield a TypeError while instantiating them."
